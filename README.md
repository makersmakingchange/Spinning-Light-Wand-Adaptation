# Spinning Light Wand Adaptation
The Spinning Light Wand Adaptation comprises instructions and files to adapt a commercially available Spinning Light Wand toy for use with an assistive switch. The toy is modified so that it has a 3.5 mm jack in place of the button. When a standard assistive switch with a 3.5 mm mono jack is attached and activated, the toy will activate. The toy is mounted into a 3D printed base that keeps the toy upright and houses the input jack.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Working_Documents/Spinning_Light_Wand_BOM_V1.1.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to adapt the Spinning Light Wand. The toy is typically available at Walmart stores.


### 2. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components 

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [Build_Files](Build_Files) folder.

### 3. Assembly

Reference the [Assembly Guide v1.0](/Documentation/Spinning_Light_Wand_Assembly_Guide_V1.0.pdf) or [Assembly Guide v1.1](/Documentation/Spinning_Light_Wand_Assembly_Guide_V1.1.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
